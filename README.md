# Prison Sentence Estimator WebApp

This will be a webapp to automate some of the calculations and scoring AL legal offices have to perform to estimate the sentencing of a particular offender. 
These can be found here: https://sentencingcommission.alacourt.gov/sentencing-standards/

I've agreed to take this project on after being asked by a friend's legal office.
This project is currently in the planning stage.

I'm familiar with how to build website/webapps from previous projects and education using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & PHP. But I feel it would be a good learning experience to build something in a modern framework. Especially, since I would like to start deploying ML models on the web in the future.

I will be leveraging React + Vite. Currently just standard CSS for styling. Perhaps a shift to Tailwind later. I don't believe a database will be necessary for this project (maybe for a login system). However, I'd like to learn a bit about Firebase. So I'll probably leverage that if the need arises.
